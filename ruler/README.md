This is a small program for computing the minimum length scale of a design pattern given by topology optimization. The theoretical basis of the method lies in morphological transformations [1,2]. Some code is copied or adapted from the filter.py file in Meep [3].


This method is outlined as follows.
1. Normalize and binarize the 2d or 3d array of the design pattern.
2. For a given filter radius, compute the difference between morphological opening and closing. This difference is a 2d or 3d array with the same shape as the design pattern.
3. Count the number of interior nonzero pixels in the image of difference. The interior nonzero pixels are those surrounded by other nonzeros pixels, as shown in the figure below.
4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 for a series of filter radii, and seek the smallest filter radius at which an interior nonzero pixel emerges. The minimum length scale is considered as twice this filter radius.
