This is an example of the inverse design of slow light waveguide design based on the supercell calculation for the Hz polarization. Fengwen Wang [@fengwen1206](https://github.com/fengwen1206) generated the design using her own  matlab code. 

The considerd supercell, initial design and corresponding design domain are illustrated in the figure below.
