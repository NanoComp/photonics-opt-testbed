This is an example of RGB metalens designs. Rasmus generated designs using his own code and reported their FOMs, which were validated on Meep by Mo. Mo also generated designs using Meep. The results are plotted for comparison.

python3 metalens_check.py path/to/design_file design_resolution checks designs (in .csv format) on Meep, and reports FOMs and lengthscales.
