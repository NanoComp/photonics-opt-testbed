We designed 2D cavity imposed under various lengthscale constraints of size 1λ by 1λ for λ=1.55μm with material of ε=12.11. We aimed to maximize the LDOS, or equivalently the power expanded by an unit source at center with Ex polarization. Mo (@mochen4) designed structures with FDTD code (Meep), and Göktuğ ( <gokisi@dtu.dk>) designed structures with FEM code; the structurs were then cross validated by each other.

The schematic of the problem and numerical results are shown below.

In the table above, red values were results from FEM and blue values were from FDTD
